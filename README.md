This project was done by Ryan and Betty, with data from Dr. Daniel Read from The Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.
Feel free to use this code, but attribute both us and the CEH.
This code was written in python, using the tensorflow library. This code is meant to be run in a jupyter notebook, and each code chunk run seperately.
